## Understanding Your Website Hosting

Your website is hosted on two main platforms:

- **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** - The service that displays your website to the world
  - Ensures your site loads quickly for visitors anywhere in the world
  - Handles automatic SSL certificate renewal (the security padlock in browsers)
  - Provides form processing for your contact forms
  - Stores submitted form data in an easy-to-access dashboard
  
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - The service that stores your website files
  - Securely stores all your website code and content
  - Keeps a complete history of all changes ever made
  - Allows for easy restoration if something goes wrong
  - Enables collaboration between multiple team members when needed

You don't need to understand the technical details of these platforms to use your website, but knowing these names will help when you need support. Think of Netlify as your website's "display case" and GitHub as your "storage vault."

## Using Your Website

### Accessing Your Website

Your website is hosted on Netlify and can be accessed at:

- Your custom domain (if set up): `www.yourcompany.com` 
- The Netlify-provided URL that was shared with you (usually ends with `.netlify.app`)

Your site is accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. If you're having trouble accessing your site:
- Check that you're typing the URL correctly (including www if needed)
- Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser
- Contact your website administrator if problems persist

### Contact Form

Your website includes a built-in contact form that allows visitors to send inquiries directly to you:

1. When a visitor submits the form, you'll receive an email notification
2. Responses are sent to the email address that was configured during setup
3. The visitor will see a success page confirming their message was sent

Your form may include fields such as:
- Name (usually required)
- Email address (required for reply)
- Phone number (optional)
- Subject or inquiry type
- Message content
- Additional custom fields specific to your business

If you need to change where form submissions are sent, contact your website administrator or visit the [Netlify Forms documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/).

**Finding Form Submissions:**
1. You'll receive email notifications for new submissions
2. All submissions are also stored in your Netlify account
3. To access stored submissions, ask your administrator or log in to Netlify:
   - Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Select your site
   - Click "Forms" in the top navigation
   - View individual submissions by clicking on them

### Custom Domain

If you've set up a custom domain for your website:

1. Your website will be accessible at your domain (e.g., www.yourcompany.com)
2. SSL certification (the padlock icon in browsers) is automatically provided for secure browsing
3. All visitors will see your professional domain in their browser

Benefits of your custom domain:
- Builds brand recognition and professionalism
- Easier for customers to remember
- Can match your business email address (e.g., info@yourcompany.com)
- Improves your business credibility

Your domain renewal is handled by either:
- Your domain registrar (if you purchased it separately)
- Netlify (if you purchased through them)

Domain renewals typically occur annually. Mark the renewal date on your calendar or set up auto-renewal to avoid interruptions to your website.

## Website Features

### 404 Error Page

Your website includes a custom 404 error page that displays when a visitor tries to access a non-existent page. This page:

- Maintains your brand's look and feel
- Provides helpful navigation options
- Ensures visitors don't leave your site due to broken links

Common scenarios when a 404 page appears:
- A visitor types in an incorrect URL
- Someone clicks an outdated link from another website
- You've renamed or moved a page without setting up a redirect

Your custom 404 page helps capture these lost visitors by:
- Acknowledging the error in a friendly way
- Offering navigation to popular pages
- Providing a search function (if enabled)
- Including contact information for assistance

Learn more about [custom 404 pages in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#custom-404).

### Redirects

Your website can automatically redirect visitors from old pages to new ones. This is useful when you:
- Change page URLs but want to keep old links working
- Need to point visitors to specific pages based on certain conditions
- Want to create shorter, easier-to-share URLs for marketing

Common redirect examples:
- `/old-service-page` automatically takes visitors to `/services/new-name`
- `/special` could redirect to a current promotion or featured product
- `/contact` might redirect to `/#contact-section` if you've moved to a one-page design

If you need to set up redirects, contact your website administrator or learn more about [redirects and rewrites in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

### Image Optimization

Your website automatically optimizes images for different devices and connections:

- Images load quickly on mobile devices
- High-quality images display on desktop browsers
- Visitors experience faster page loading times

Benefits for your business:
- Better user experience leads to longer site visits
- Faster loading improves search engine rankings
- Reduces bandwidth costs and server load
- Provides sharp, clear images on high-resolution displays

When providing new images for your site:
- Use high-quality original photos whenever possible
- Avoid low-resolution or pixelated images
- For best results, provide images in JPG, PNG, or WebP formats
- Include descriptive filenames (e.g., "team-meeting-2024.jpg" instead of "IMG12345.jpg")

Learn more about [Netlify Image CDN](https://docs.netlify.com/image-cdn/overview/).

### AI Bot Protection

Your website includes protection against AI crawlers:

- Prevents AI models from scraping your content
- Helps protect your original content from being used to train AI systems
- Maintains control over your intellectual property

This protection works by:
- Adding special code to your website that tells AI systems not to use your content
- Including HTTP headers that legally restrict content usage
- Following industry best practices for content protection

While no protection is 100% foolproof, these measures significantly reduce the likelihood of your content being used without permission.

## Configuration Through netlify.toml

Your website includes a special configuration file called `netlify.toml` that handles many settings automatically. This file:

- Sets up your custom 404 error page
- Configures security settings to protect your content
- Enables form handling for your contact form
- Optimizes image and file loading for better performance

When you deploy to Netlify, this file will be automatically detected and applied, so you don't need to manually configure these settings through the Netlify dashboard.

If you need to modify any of these settings, your developer can update this file for you.

## Accessing Your Website Files

Your website is developed and managed through GitHub, which stores all your website files. As a client, you have two main options for accessing these files:

### Becoming a GitHub Collaborator

Your developer can add you as a collaborator to the website repository:

1. Create a free GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. Send your GitHub username to your developer
3. Accept the email invitation to collaborate on the repository
4. You'll be able to view all website files in the GitHub interface

### Connecting Your Netlify Account to GitHub

To deploy your website on your own Netlify account:

1. Create a GitHub account (if you haven't already)
2. Create a Netlify account at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com/)
3. After becoming a GitHub collaborator, log in to Netlify
4. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
5. Select "GitHub" and authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
6. Select the Pixel Perfect repository from the list
7. Configure basic settings (your developer can provide these)
8. Click "Deploy site"

This setup gives you ownership of both your Netlify hosting and access to view the website files on GitHub.

## Making Updates to Your Website

If you need changes made to your website:

1. Small content updates: Contact your website administrator with the specific changes needed
   - Text corrections or updates
   - New contact information
   - Team member additions or removals
   - Service description updates

2. Adding new pages: Describe the content and purpose of the new pages to your administrator
   - Target audience for the page
   - Key information to include
   - Any specific calls-to-action
   - How the page should link to existing content

3. Design changes: Provide examples or descriptions of the design changes you'd like
   - Reference websites with elements you like
   - Describe the specific sections you want changed
   - Explain your reasoning for the changes
   - Provide any brand guidelines to follow

Your website files are stored securely in GitHub, which keeps track of all changes and allows for easy updates. This means:
- No changes are ever permanently lost
- Previous versions can be restored if needed
- Changes can be previewed before going live
- Multiple updates can be made at once

### Recommended Update Process

For the smoothest experience, follow these steps when requesting updates:

1. Compile all your changes into a single request when possible
2. Be specific about what needs to be changed
3. Provide all necessary content (text, images, links)
4. Indicate any deadline or priority for the changes
5. Review the changes when they're ready
6. Provide feedback in a single, organized response

## Website Maintenance

Your website benefits from regular maintenance, which may include:

- **Security updates**: Keeping software components up-to-date
- **Performance monitoring**: Ensuring your site loads quickly
- **Content freshness**: Regularly updating information to stay relevant
- **Backup verification**: Confirming your site data is properly backed up

Most of these tasks happen automatically or are handled by your administrator, but you should:
- Regularly review your site content for accuracy
- Notify your administrator of any issues you notice
- Plan for periodic content refreshes to keep information current

## Need Help?

If you need assistance with your website or have questions, contact your website administrator.

Common questions you might have:
- "How do I update my business hours?"
- "Can we add a new team member to the About page?"
- "How do I view form submissions from the contact form?"
- "Can we add a gallery of recent projects?"
- "How do I change where form submissions are sent?"
